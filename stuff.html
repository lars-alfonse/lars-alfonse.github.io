				<p>
				The moment you have been wating for has finally arrived. Seasons two and three of <span>FLCL</span> have finally been announced!<br> Fans have been yearning for more content from the studio behind Gurren Laggan, Neon Genisis Evangelion, and many other great titles.The real question here is: "Should it be done?" <br> The challenge of reviving a series will bring many hurdles, and while I have no doubts about the abilities of Gainax and their directors, I worry about the Shonen syndrome. <br> Many Shonen titles have an infinite amount of story arcs, and this makes the series seem to drag and lose much of its sheen. FLCL was different because it, <i>like many other Gainax titles</i>, has a singular plot arc that reaches its desired conflict point and then <em>concludes</em>. Giving veiwers the closure that it needs. When talking about reviving FLCL for another season, it brings the risk of destroying our idea of the series. </p>

 					<p class="mb-0">In the new season of FLCL, many years have passed since Naota and Haruhara Haruko shared their adventure together. Meanwhile, the war between the two entities known as Medical Mechanica and Fraternity rages across the galaxy. Enter Hidomi, a young teenaged girl who believes there is nothing amazing to expect from her average life, until one day when a new teacher named Haruko arrives at her school. Soon enough, Medical Mechanica is attacking her town and Hidomi discovers a secret within her that could save everyone, a secret that only Haruko can unlock.<br>But why did Haruko return to Earth? What happened to her Rickenbacker 4001 she left with Naota? And where did the human-type robot 'Canti' go?</p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse" align="left">I’m writing to urge you to keep our Open Internet rules based on Title II in place. Without them, we could lose the internet as we know it.
The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard.
Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.
Thank you!
