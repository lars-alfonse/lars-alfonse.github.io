				<p>
				The moment you have been wating for has finally arrived. Seasons two and three of <span>FLCL</span> have finally been announced!<br> Fans have been yearning for more content from the studio behind Gurren Laggan, Neon Genisis Evangelion, and many other great titles.The real question here is: "Should it be done?" <br> The challenge of reviving a series will bring many hurdles, and while I have no doubts about the abilities of Gainax and their directors, I worry about the Shonen syndrome. <br> Many Shonen titles have an infinite amount of story arcs, and this makes the series seem to drag and lose much of its sheen. FLCL was different because it, <i>like many other Gainax titles</i>, has a singular plot arc that reaches its desired conflict point and then <em>concludes</em>. Giving veiwers the closure that it needs. When talking about reviving FLCL for another season, it brings the risk of destroying our idea of the series. </p>

 					<p class="mb-0">In the new season of FLCL, many years have passed since Naota and Haruhara Haruko shared their adventure together. Meanwhile, the war between the two entities known as Medical Mechanica and Fraternity rages across the galaxy. Enter Hidomi, a young teenaged girl who believes there is nothing amazing to expect from her average life, until one day when a new teacher named Haruko arrives at her school. Soon enough, Medical Mechanica is attacking her town and Hidomi discovers a secret within her that could save everyone, a secret that only Haruko can unlock.<br>But why did Haruko return to Earth? What happened to her Rickenbacker 4001 she left with Naota? And where did the human-type robot 'Canti' go?</p>

		The proposed changes to FCC rules would allow fast lanes for sites that pay, and force everyone else into slow lanes. We’ve already seen access to streaming services like Netflix, popular games like League of Legends, and communication platforms like FaceTime slowed down, or even blocked. Conditions like this hurt businesses large and small, and penalize the users who patronize them. 
		The changes also open the door to unfair taxes on internet users, and could also make it harder for blogs, nonprofits, artists, and others who can’t pay up to have their voices heard.
		Please leave the existing existing net neutrality rules based on Title II in place.
		Thank you!

		<h2>
			We are in danger of losing the internet!
		</h2>
			<p>Congress is currently onsidering a law that will allow ISP's to restrict bandwith to websites and companies unless those companies pay them a premium fee. In otherwords: if you have content on the internet you would have to pay ISP's to ensure that veiwers can access your pages quickly. While this may not seem like a big deal if you dont pay for it, this can impact the rate at which your content is veiwed, your SEO and ultimately, your livleyhood. This has already impacted many users; in the quote above, Tumblr staff references the choke that was place on riot games and their product, League of Legends; Comcast forced Riot Games to pay to fix TWC's DNS server in order to open the bandwith of their users in New York, and after Riot paid, the bandwidths were fixed as if by magic. Riot sued them for bottling and essentially holding their connections, and users, for ransom. This is just one example of how this law can impact all of us. <br>
